        <h1>Hi! It's my test task. Thnx!</h1>
        <p>I'm not designer so it is not looking pretty. I didn't want spend my time with reading documentation of
            styled-components, because it's new for me and it will be not fast.</p>
        <p>Sorry, but I have not already learn ESLint or TypeScript. I'll do it asap.</p>
        <p>I want you to know, it is my first practice in whole life. I have never written on react, redux, saga before. I was just reading and watching videos about it.</p>
        <p>Hope, you will tell me about my errors and warnings (I'm not about the console. I'm about my code looks like)</p>
